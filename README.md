# Emotion Detection with CNN: Happy or Sad Image Classification


## 📌 Project Overview

As a data scientist at an entertainment company, the goal of this project is to detect the emotional state (happy or sad) of visitors through image recognition. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the model classifies images into two categories: **Happy (1)** or **Sad (0)**. This helps the company evaluate audience reactions and enhance the quality of shows.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Build a **binary classification model** to predict the emotional state based on facial images using CNN. The process includes:
- Preprocessing and augmenting images
- Designing and visualizing a CNN architecture
- Training and evaluating the model

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Happy and Sad Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shamstabrezkhan/happy-and-sad-images-dataset-for-cnn)
- Classes: `happy`, `sad`
- Format: Labeled images stored in class folders

## 🛠️ Libraries & Tools

- `tensorflow`, `keras`
- `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `os`
- `ImageDataGenerator` for data augmentation
- `kagglehub` for dataset import
